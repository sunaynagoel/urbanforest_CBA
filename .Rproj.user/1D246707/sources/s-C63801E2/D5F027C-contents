Column {.sidebar data-width=300}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
### Cost Benefit Analysis of developing Urban Forest in Phoenix, AZ. 

**Location**: Phoenix, AZ -- State Capital of Arizoan and Fifth most populous ciy in the United States.    
**Objectives**: Increase the Urban forest to offset the Carbon-Di-Oxide (CO2) generated by air travel by providing Cost-Beneefit analysis of five most comman urban tree species in the area.    
**Data Used**: Cost and Benefit of each of those species for a span 30 years.    
**Process**: Investigate the number of trees needed to offest the CO2 generated by a flight. Then navigate through details of cost and benefit provided by these trees while presenting the user with Net Present Value of the tree investement. 


Column

### Phoenix 

```{r}
fillRow( 
        
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles(options = providerTileOptions(minZoom = 8, maxZoom = 10)) %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-112.0740, lat=33.4484, popup="City Center Phoenix, AZ")

)

### Carbon generated by flights and Trees needed to offset that carbon


```{r}
#colnames(dat)
dat %>% 
  filter (dat$species %in% input$species_trees)


```

*** 
Six hours flight (cross country flight) generates approximately 3700 lbs of carbon in a round trip. 
Three hours flight (Same sector flight) generates approximately 1270 lbs of carbon in a round trip. 
Two hour flight (same sector shorter flight) generates approximately 950 lbs of carbon in a round trip.
One hour flight generates approximately 380 lbs of carbon in a round trip.
The carbon is calculated for a single passenger in economy class.

```{r}
selectInput("lbs_carbon", label = "Carbon generated by a round trip airtravel:",
            choices = c(3700, 1270, 950,380), selected = 3700)

selectInput("species_trees", label = "Type of the tree to be planted:",
            choices = c("mesquite", "blue palo verde", "aleppo pine", "palo brea", "chinese elm"), selected = "mesquite")
```




```{r}

radioButtons("radio.flight", label = h4("Select an appropriate round trip flight"),
    choices = list("Cross Counrty Flight (Approximately Six Hours Flight)" = "3700",
                "Same Sector Flight (Approximately Three Hours Flight)" = "1210",
                "Same Sector shorter Flight (Approximately Two hours Flight)" = "950"), 
    selected = c("3700")
             )


#fluidPage(
 # radioButtons("radio.flight", label = h3("Select an appropriate round trip flight"),
  #  choices = list("Cross Counrty Flight (Approximately Six Hours Flight)" = 1, 
    #               "Same Sector Flight (Approximately Three Hours Flight) " = 2, 
     #              "Same Sector shorter Flight (Approximately Two hours Flight)" = 3), 
   # selected = 1)
#,
   # hr(),
 # fluidRow(column(3, verbatimTextOutput("value")))
#)

## insert widget for tree selection by the user from the list provided
fluidPage(
  radioButtons("radio.tree", label = h3("Select the type of tree to offset carbon generated"),
    choices = list("Mesquite" = "mesquite", 
                   "Blue Palo Verde " = "blue palo verde", 
                   "Aleppo Pine" = "aleppo pine",
                   "Chinese Elm" = "chinese elm",

 # hr(),
